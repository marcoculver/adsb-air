## Standby Duty

| Type | Maximum Duration |
|------|------------------|
| Standby duty (all cases) | 12 hours |

### Standby + FDP Rules

**Case A - Called out before 6 hours standby:**
- Total allowed = Standby time + Full FDP from table

**Case B - Called out after 6+ hours standby:**
- Total allowed = Standby time + FDP - (Standby time - 6 hours)

**After standby without call-out:**
- Flight crew: 12 hours rest before next duty
- Cabin crew: 11 hours rest before next duty

---

## Delay Rules

### Delayed Reporting (Single FDP)

| Delay Duration | FDP Calculation |
|----------------|-----------------|
| < 4 hours | Max FDP based on original report time, FDP starts at actual report time |
| 4-10 hours | Max FDP from more limiting time band, FDP starts 4h after original report |
| >= 10 hours | If not disturbed, period counts as rest |

---

## Positioning (Deadheading)

- Counts as duty but NOT as a sector
- FDP starts at positioning report time
- Subsequent rest must account for FDP + positioning
- If followed by rest < minimum then FDP: positioning counts as sector for split duty

---

## Quick Reference for FDP Calculator

### Inputs Needed:
1. Crew type (Flight Crew / Cabin Crew)
2. Report time (local)
3. Number of sectors (1-4)
4. Acclimatization status
5. Preceding rest length (if not acclimatized)

### Outputs to Calculate:
1. Maximum FDP
2. Latest on-chocks time (FDP end)
3. Latest off-duty time (+30 min post-flight)
4. Time into discretion
5. Maximum discretion available
6. Absolute limit (FDP + max discretion)

### Color Coding Suggestions:
- **Green**: Within normal FDP
- **Yellow**: Within 1 hour of FDP limit
- **Orange**: In discretion (1-2 hours)
- **Red**: Deep discretion (2-3 hours) or approaching limit
